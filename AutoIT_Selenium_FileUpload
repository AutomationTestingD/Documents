Upload File in Selenium Webdriver using Autoit
*****************************************************************************************

To Upload File in Selenium Webdriver using Autoit we need to take care of some steps so let’s begin
To upload a file in Selenium Webdriver we will create AutoIT script, which will handle file-uploaded window, and then we will combine 
Selenium script with AutoIt scripts.

Click on Upload button you will get file uploader we will handle the same using AutoIt.
 
Step 1- Open Editor and Finder Tool
Step 2– We need to write script to upload file so we will use some method of AutoIt.
Each method will have some own functionality
ControlFocus-This will give focus on the window
ControlSetText-This will set the file path
ControlClick-This will click on button


Step 1- 
Click on Browse button , a new window will open now open finder tool and Click on Finder tool and drag to the file name.
(file name textbox 
from browse window)

This will give all the detail about that window and file name section info; we will use only some attribute like window title, 
class, and instance.
Open AutoIt Editor and Write Script

Script:
ControlFocus("File Upload", "","Edit1")  //comment: Edit1 is control id - This is combination of Class+Instance. 
File Upload is window Title
ControlSetText("File Upload","","Edit1","filePath")
ControlClick("File Upload", "", "Button1")

In ControlClick method we will give control id of open button
Step 2-
Save the script to a particular location with some unique name.
Note- By default script will be saved as .au3 extension

Step 3– Now Compile the script so for compiling right click on file and Select compile script this will generate a .exe file 
of the file.

Step 4- Now write Selenium program and add this .exe file and run your program

 public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
                
// This will open Firefox browser
WebDriver driver=new FirefoxDriver();
        
// This will maximize browser to full screen
driver.manage().window().maximize();
        
// This will open respective URL
driver.get("your application url");
        
// This will click on Upload button
driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@type='file']")).click();
     
// This will invoke AutoIT script here give the path of the script 
//and this will throw IO exception so u can use throw or try catch
// In my case I am using throws
 
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("C:\\Users\\mukesh_otwani\\Desktop\\AutoItScripts\\blogUpload.exe");
 
// Once you will run this program AutoIt script will be invoked and respective f//ile will be attached
