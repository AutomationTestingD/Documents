Selenium WebDriver Architecture
*****************************************************************************************************************************


There are four components of Selenium Architecture:

Selenium Client Library
JSON Wire Protocol over HTTP
Browser Drivers
Browsers


Selenium Client Libraries/Language Bindings:
Selenium supports multiple libraries such as Java, Ruby, Python, etc., Selenium Developers have developed language
bindings to allow Selenium to support multiple languages

JSON WIRE PROTOCOL Over HTTP Client:
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is used to transfer data between a server and a client on the web.
JSON Wire Protocol is a REST API that transfers the information between HTTP server. Each BrowserDriver (such as FirefoxDriver,
ChromeDriver etc.,)  has its own HTTP server.

Browser Drivers:
Each browser contains separate browser driver. Browser drivers communicate with respective browser without revealing the internal
logic of browser’s functionality. When a browser driver is  received any command then that command will be executed on the respective
browser and the response will go back in the form of HTTP response..

Browsers:
Selenium supports multipe browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, IE, Safari etc.,


*****************************************************************************************************************************
Example:

WebDriver driver  = new FirefoxDriver();
driver.get(https://www.softwaretestingmaterial.com)

Once you are ready with your script, you will click on Run to execute the program. Based on the above statements,
Firefox browser will be launched and it wil
navigates to softwartestingmaterial website.
Here we see what will happen internally after you click on Run till the launch of Firefox browser.
Once you click on Run, every statement in your script will be converted as a URL with the help of JSON Wire Protocol over HTTP. 
The URL’s will be passed to the Browser Drivers. (In the above code, we took FirefoxDriver). Here in our case the client library (java)
will convert the statements of the script to JSON format and communicates with the FirefoxDriver. URL looks as shown below.


http://localhost:8080/{"url":"https://www.softwaretestingmaterial.com"}

Every Browser Driver uses a HTTP server to receive HTTP requests.  Once the URL reaches the Browser Driver, 
then the Browser Driver will pass that request to the real browser over HTTP. Then the commands in your selenium script will 
be executed on the browser.
If the request is POST request then there will be an action on browser
If the request is a GET request then the corresponding response will be generated at the browser end and it will be sent over
.HTTP to the browser driver and the Browser Driver over JSON Wire Protocol and sends it to the UI (Eclipse IDE).
