1) What is Selenium and what is composed of?

Selenium is a suite of tools for automated web testing.  It is composed of

Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment) :  It is a tool for recording and playing back.  It is a firefox plugin
WebDriver and RC:  It provide the APIs for a variety of languages like Java, .NET, PHP, etc. With most of the browsers Webdriver and RC works.
Grid: With the help of Grid you can distribute tests on multiple machines so that test can be run parallel which helps in cutting down the time required for running in browser test suites


2) What is Selenium 2.0 ?

Web Testing tools Selenium RC and WebDriver are consolidated in single tool in Selenium 2.0



3) Mention what is Selenium 3.0?

Selenium 3.0 is the latest version of Selenium. It has released 2 beta versions of selenium 3.0 with few of the below changes:

Here are few new features added to Selenium 3.0

ID
Name
Tag
Attribute
CSS
Linktext
PartialLink Text
Xpath etc

b) Hudson

c) Quick Build

d) CruiseCont

6) Explain what is assertion in Selenium and what are the types of assertion?


Assertion is used as a  verification point. It verifies that the state of the application conforms to what is expected.  The types of assertion are “assert” , “verify” and “waifFor”.

7) Mention what is the use of X-path?

X-Path is used to find the WebElement in web pages. It is also useful in identifying the dynamic elements.

Refer Complete Guide on XPath

8) Explain the difference between single and double slash in X-path? Single slash ‘/ ’

Single slash ( / ) start selection from the document node
It allows you to create ‘absolute’ path expressions
Double Slash ‘// ’
Double slash ( // ) start selection matching anywhere in the document
It enables to create ‘relative’ path expressions
9) List out the technical challenges with Selenium? Technical challenges with Selenium are

Selenium supports only web based applications
It does not support the Bitmap comparison
For any reporting related capabilities have to depend on third party tools
No vendor support for tool compared to commercial tools like HP UFT
As there is no object repository concept in Selenium, maintainability of objects becomes difficult
10) What is the difference between type keys and type commands ?

TypeKeys() will trigger JavaScript event in most of the cases whereas .type() won’t. Type key populates the value attribute using JavaScript whereas .typekeys() emulates like actual user typing

11) What is the difference between verify and assert commands?

Assert:  Assert allows to check whether an element is on the page or not. The test will stop on the step failed, if the asserted element is not available. In other words, the test will terminated at the point where check fails.

Verify: Verify command will check whether the element is on the page, if it is not then the test will carry on executing.  In verification, all the commands are going to run guaranteed even if any of test fails.

12) What is JUnit Annotations and what are different types of annotations which are useful ?

In JAVA a special form of syntactic meta-data can be added to Java source code, this is know as Annotations.  Variables, parameters, packages, methods and classes are annotated some of the Junit annotations which can be useful are

Test
Before
After
Ignore
BeforeClass
AfterClass
RunWith
13) While using click command can you use screen coordinate?

Host
Port Number
Browser
URL
17) What is the difference between setSpeed() and sleep() methods?


Both will delay the speed of execution.

Thread.sleep () :  It will stop the current (java) thread for the specified period of time.  Its done only once

It takes a single argument in integer format
Ex: thread.sleep(2000)- It will wait for 2 seconds
It waits only once at the command given at sleep
SetSpeed () :  For specific amount of time it will stop the execution for every selenium command.
It takes a single argument in integer format
Ex: selenium.setSpeed(“2000”)- It will wait for 2 seconds
Runs each command  after setSpeed delay by the number of milliseconds mentioned in set Speed
This command is useful for  demonstration purpose or if you are using a slow web application
18) What is same origin policy? How you can avoid same origin policy?

The “Same Origin Policy” is introduced for security reason, and it ensures that content of your site will never be accessible by a script from another site.  As per the policy, any code loaded within the browser can only operate within that website’s domain.

To avoid “Same Origin Policy” proxy injection method is used, in proxy injection mode the Selenium Server acts as a client configured HTTP proxy , which sits between the browser and application under test and then masks the AUT under a fictional URL

19) What is heightened privileges browsers?

The purpose of heightened privileges is similar to Proxy Injection, allows websites to do something that are not commonly permitted.  The key difference is that the browsers are launced in a special mode called heightened privileges.  By using these browser mode, Selenium core can open the AUT directly and also read/write its content without passing the whole AUT through the Selenium RC server.

20) How you can use “submit” a form using Selenium ?

You can use “submit” method on element to submit form-

element.submit () ;

Alternatively you can use click method on the element which does form submission

Support for data-driven testing
Flexible test configuration
Ability to re-execute failed test cases
22) Mention what is the difference between Implicit wait and Explicit wait?

Implicit Wait: Sets a timeout for all successive Web Element searches. For the specified amount of time it will try looking for element again and again before throwing a NoSuchElementException.  It waits for elements to show up.

Explicit Wait :  It is a one-timer, used for a particular search.

23) Which attribute you should consider throughout the script in frame for “if no frame Id as well as no frame name”?

You can use…..driver.findElements(By.xpath(“//iframe”))….

This will return list of frames.

You will ned to  switch to each and every frame and search for locator which we want.


Then break the loop

24) Explain what is the difference between find elements () and find element () ?

find element ():

It finds the first element within the current page using the given “locating mechanism”.  It returns a single WebElement

findElements () : Using the given “locating mechanism” find all the elements within the current page.  It returns a list of web elements.

25) Explain what are the JUnits annotation linked with Selenium?

The JUnits annotation linked with Selenium are

@Before public void method() – It will perform the method () before each test, this method can prepare the test
@Test public void method() – Annotations @Test identifies that this method is a test method environment
@After public void method()- To execute a method before this annotation is used, test method must start with test@Before
26) Explain what is Datadriven framework and Keyword driven?

Datadriven framework:  In this framework, the test data is separated and kept outside the Test Scripts, while Test Case logic resides in Test Scripts.  Test data is read from the external files ( Excel Files) and are loaded into the variables inside the Test Script.  Variables are used for both for input values and for verification values.

Keyworddriven framework: The keyword driven frameworks requires the development of data tables and keywords, independent of the test automation.  In a keyword driven test, the functionality of the application under test is documented in a table as well as step by step instructions for each test.

27) Explain how you can login into any site if it’s showing any authentication popup for password and username?

You can use “type”command to type in a file input box of upload file. Then, you have to use “Robot” class in JAVA to make file upload work.

43) Which web driver implementation is fastest?

HTMLUnit Driver implementation is fastest, HTMLUnitDriver does not execute tests on browser but plain http request, which is far quick than launching a browser and executing tests

44) Explain how you can handle frames using Selenium 2.0 ?

To bring control on HTML frame you can use “SwitchTo” frame method-

driver.switchTo().frame(“frameName”);

To specify a frame you can use index number

driver.switchTo().frame(“parentFrame.4.frameName”);

This would bring control on frame named- “frameName” of the 4th sub frame names “parentFrame”

45) What is the difference between getWindowhandles() and getwindowhandle() ?

getwindowhandles(): It is used to get the address of all the open browser and its return type is Set<String>

getwindowhandle(): It is used to get the address of the current browser where the control is and return type is string

46) Explain how you can switch back from a frame?

On different platforms and  different web browser for automating web application  selenium RC is used with languages like Java, C#, Perl, Python
Selenium RC is a java based and using any language it can interact with the web application
Using server you can bypass the restriction and run your automation script running against any web application
74) Why Selenium RC is used?

Selenium IDE does not directly support many functions like condition statements, Iteration, logging and reporting of test results, unexpected error handling and so on as IDE supports only HTML language.  To handle such issues Selenium RC is used  it supports the language like Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP using these languages we can write the program to achieve the IDE issues.

75) Explain what is the main difference between web-driver and RC ?

The main difference between Selenium RC and Webdriver is that, selenium RC injects javascript function into browsers when the page is loaded. On the other hand, Selenium Webdriver drives the browser using browsers built in support

76) What are the advantages of RC?

Advantages of RC are

Can read or write data from/ to .xls, .txt, etc
It can handle dynamic objects and Ajax based UI elements
Loops and conditions can be used for better performance and flexibility
Support many Programming languages and Operating Systems
For any JAVA script enabled browser Selenium RC can be used
77) Explain what is framework and what are the frameworks available in RC?

A collection of libraries and classes is known as Framework and they are helpful when testers has to automate test cases. NUnit, JUnit, TestNG, Bromine, RSpec, unittest are some of the frameworks available in RC .

78) How can we handle pop-ups in RC ?

To handle pop-ups in RC , using selectWindow method, pop-up window will be selected and windowFocus method will let the control from current window to pop-up windows and perform actions according to script

79) What are the technical limitations while using Selenium RC?

Apart from “same origin policy” restriction from js, Selenium is also restricted from exercising anything that is outside browser.

80) Can we use Selenium RC to drive tests on two different browsers on one operating system without Selenium Grid?

Yes, it is possible when you are not using JAVA testing framework.  Instead of using Java testing framework if you are using java client driver of selenium then TestNG allows you to do this.  By using “parallel=test” attribute you can set tests to be executed in parallel and can define two different tests, each using different browser.

81) Why to use TestNG with Selenium RC ?

If you want full automation against different server and client platforms, You need a way to invoke the tests from a command line process, reports that tells you what happened and flexibility in how you create your test suites. TestNG gives that flexibility.

82) Explain how you can capture server side log Selenium Server?

To capture server side log in Selenium Server, you can use command

java –jar .jar –log selenium.log

To handle network latency you can use driver.manage.pageloadingtime for network latency

86) To enter values onto text boxes what is the command that can be used?

To enter values onto text boxes we can use command sendkeys()

87) How do you identify an object using selenium?

To identify an object using Selenium you can use

isElementPresent(String locator)

isElementPresent takes a locator as the argument and if found returns a Boolean

88) In Selenium what are Breakpoints and Startpoints?

Breakpoints: When you implement a breakpoint in your code, the execution will stop right there. This helps you to verify that your code is working as expected.
StartpointsStartpoint indicates the point from where the execution should begin. Startpoint can be used when you want to run the testscript from the middle of the code or a breakpoint.
89) Mention why to choose Python over Java in Selenium?

Few points that favor Python over Java to use with Selenium is,

Java programs tend to run slower compared to Python programs.
Java uses traditional braces to start and ends blocks, while Python uses indentation.
Java employs static typing, while Python is dynamically typed.
Python is simpler and more compact compared to Java.
90) Mention what are the challenges in Handling Ajax Call in Selenium Webdriver?

The challenges faced in Handling Ajax Call in Selenium Webdriver are

Using "pause" command for handling Ajax call is not completely reliable. Long pause time makes the test unacceptably slow and increases the testing time. Instead, "waitforcondition" will be more helpful in testing Ajax applications.
It is difficult to assess the risk associated with particular Ajax applications
Given full freedom to developers to modify Ajax application makes the testing process challenging
Creating automated test request may be difficult for testing tools as such AJAX application often use different encoding or serialization technique to submit POST data.
91) Mention what is IntelliJ?

Intellij is an IDE that helps you to write better and faster code for Selenium. Intellij can be used in the option to Java bean and Eclipse.

92) Mention in what ways you can customize TestNG report?

Using ITestListener Interface
Using IReporter Interface
93) To generate pdf reports mention what Java API is required?

To generate pdf reports, you need Java API IText.

94) Mention what is Listeners in Selenium WebDriver?

In Selenium WebDriver, Listeners "listen" to the event defined in the selenium script and behave accordingly. It allows customizing TestNG reports or logs. There are two main listeners i.e. WebDriver Listeners and TestNG Listeners.

95) Mention what are the types of Listeners in TestNG?

The types of Listeners in TestNG are,

IAnnotationTransformer
IAnnotationTransformer2
IConfigurable
IConfigurationListener
IExecutionListener
IHookable
IInvokedMethodListener
IInvokedMethodListener2
IMethodInterceptor
IReporter
ISuiteListener
ITestListener
96) Mention what is desired capability? How is it useful in terms of Selenium?

The desired capability is a series of key/value pairs that stores the browser properties like browser name, browser version, the path of the browser driver in the system, etc. to determine the behavior of the browser at run time.

For Selenium,

It can be used to configure the driver instance of Selenium WebDriver.
When you want to run the test cases on a different browser with different operating systems and versions.
97) For Database Testing in Selenium Webdriver what API is required?

For Database Testing in Selenium Webdriver, you need JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API. It allows you to execute SQL statements.

98) Mention when to use AutoIT?

Selenium is designed to automate web-based applications on different browsers. But to handle window GUI and non-HTML popups in the application you need AutoIT. know more about How to use AutoIT with Selenium

99) Mention why do you need Session Handling while working with Selenium?

While working with Selenium, you need Session Handling. This is because, during test execution, the Selenium WebDriver has to interact with the browser all the time to execute given commands. At the time of execution, it is also possible that, before current execution completes, someone else starts execution of another script, in the same machine and in the same type of browser. So to avoid such situation you need Session Handling.

100) Mention what are the advantages of Using Git Hub For Selenium?

The advantages of Using Git Hub for Selenium are

Multiple people when they work on the same project they can update project details and inform other team members simultaneously.
Jenkins can help you to build the project from the remote repository regularly. This helps you to keep track of failed builds.
